# File Extensions

The preferred **file extension** for LDPL source files is '**.ldpl**'. The alternative '**.lsc**' \(**L**DPL **S**ource **C**ode\) should also be accepted if the later interfered with existing file extensions.

{% hint style="info" %}
File extensions are important: they tell editors how to recognize your source code and the compiler how to treat your files.
