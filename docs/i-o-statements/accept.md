# ACCEPT

The `ACCEPT` command is used to gather input from the user. If a TEXT variable is specified, anything the user enters before pressing the 'return' key will be accepted. If a NUMBER variable is specified, the user must enter a number \(if any non-numeric key is entered, the error message "Redo from start" will be output and the ACCEPT command rerun\).

#### Syntax:

```c
ACCEPT <TEXT-VAR or NUMBER-VAR>
```
