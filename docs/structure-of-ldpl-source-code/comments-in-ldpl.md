# Comments in LDPL

**Comments** in LDPL are denoted with a hash symbol \('\#'\) and can be placed both on their own line or at the end of a line that already contains a statement. Everything after the hash is considered to be part of the comment and, therefore, not executed nor compiled.

```coffeescript
DATA: #This is the DATA section 

PROCEDURE: 
  #This is a comment within the PROCEDURE section! 
```
