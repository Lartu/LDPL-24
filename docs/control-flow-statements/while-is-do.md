# WHILE - IS - DO

The `WHILE` statement evaluates if the condition given by the relational operator between the first and second values is positive. While it is, the code between the `WHILE` and `REPEAT` statements is repeatedly ran.

#### Syntax:

```python
WHILE <NUMBER-VAR or NUMBER> IS <REL-OP-NUM> <NUMBER-VAR or NUMBER> DO
 #Code goes here
REPEAT 
```

or

```python
WHILE <TEXT-VAR or TEXT> IS <REL-OP-TEXT> <TEXT-VAR or TEXT> DO
 #Code goes here
REPEAT 
```

**Possible values of `REL-OP-NUM` \(number relational operator\):**

* `EQUAL TO`
* `NOT EQUAL TO`
* `GREATER THAN`
* `LESS THAN`
* `GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO`
* `LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO`

**Possible values of `REL-OP-TEXT` \(text relational operator\):**

* `EQUAL TO`
* `NOT EQUAL TO`
