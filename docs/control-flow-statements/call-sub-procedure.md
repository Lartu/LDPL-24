# CALL SUB-PROCEDURE

The `CALL SUB-PROCEDURE` statement executes a SUB-PROCEDURE. Once the SUB-PROCEDURE returns, the execution continues from the line following the `CALL SUB-PROCEDURE`.

#### Syntax:

```text
CALL SUB-PROCEDURE <sub-procedure name>
```

or just

```text
CALL <sub-procedure name>
```

Of course, a [sub-procedure must be declared](../structure-of-ldpl-source-code/sub-procedures.md) before calling it.
