# Default Variable Values

In LDPL each variable is initialized with a value by default. This means that when you declare a variable, it will, by default, hold this value until it's changed.

**NUMBER** variables are initialized with the value `0`. Each position of a **NUMBER VECTOR** is a NUMBER variable, and thus also initialized to `0`.

**TEXT** variables are initialized to the empty string `""`. Same goes to **TEXT VECTOR**s, where each position is also initialized to `""`.
